# Classification-Algorithms

- Exercise 1
Create at least two different classification models to try to predict the best one for the classes in the attached file.



- Exercise 2
Compare the classification models using accuracy, a fuzziness matrix and other more advanced metrics.



- Exercise 3
Train them using the different parameters they admit in order to improve their prediction.



- Exercise 4
Compare their performance using the test/trait or cross-validation approach.



- Exercise 5
Apply some engineering process to improve the results (normalization, standardization, sampling...).
